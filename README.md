# Humble Scheme

This is a Python implementation of the Humble Scheme language.
It is an interpreter.  The purpose is to serve as a simple
reference implementation.

As an example we extend with curses and create the
SNAKE game, maintaining a persisted high-score.

Please see the comments in "mics.py" itself for an introduction.
